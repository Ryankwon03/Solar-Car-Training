# Simplified Simulator


## Purpose

This project is meant to introduce trainees to object-oriented programming in C++, 
but much of the design work has already been done.  Completing this project should give some idea
of how optimizations work in the Simulator and will give practice with the C++ language.  
Once finished the project, trainees will have completed training and will be ready to work 
on the real Simulator, or any of our other ongoing projects in the Strategy/Software division.
